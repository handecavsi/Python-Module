# Nobel Prize Data Analyses
Data analysis has been performed on the Nobel Prize dataset to answer the following questions:

What are the top ten countries that have won the most Nobel Prizes?
Who were the first women to win Nobel Prizes?
Who were the first men to win Nobel Prizes?
What factors contribute to visualizing the dominance of the country that has won the most Nobel Prizes, and from which year does this dominance start? Can you provide insights?
How can the Nobel Prize winners be visualized based on their gender, age, award category, and year? (Separate graphics should be shown for each award category.) Please interpret the visualizations accordingly.
How can the categories and countries of Nobel Prize winners between 1938 and 1945 be visualized and interpreted?
How can the categories and countries of Nobel Prize winners between 1947 and 1991 be visualized and interpreted? (A separate graphic is required for each category.)
How can the countries and ages of people who won Nobel Prizes after 2000 be visualized in the categories of Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Medicine? (Separate visualizations are required for each category.) Please provide interpretations of the data.
